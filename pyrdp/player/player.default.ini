# Configuration specified on the command line has

#
# On most Linux distributions, this file should be in
#
#     $HOME/.config/pyrdp/player.ini
#
# On Windows systems, the file should be in:
#
#     %APPDATA%/pyrdp/player.ini
# 
# On MacOS:
#
#     ~/Library/Application Support/pyrdp/player.ini
#
# Subsections are delimited by the `:` character to avoid ambiguity with
# logger names (e.g. `pyrdp.player.ui`)

# This section defines global variables. Variables can be referenced
# by using the `$(vars:varname)` syntax.

# It should be possible to change all interesting aspects of the
# configuration through this section

# To disable a logger, simply remove its `level = ...` line.
