Special thanks to https://github.com/citronneur[Sylvain Peyrefitte] who
created RDPy on which we initially based PyRDP. We eventually had to fork due
to drastic changes in order to achieve the capabilities we were interested in
building. That said, his initial architecture and base library choices should
be recognized as they stood the test of time.
